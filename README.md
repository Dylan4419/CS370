Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project we were give uncompleted code and our goal was to work within the codes main loop to create a program that would allow an agent to decide an action strategy to complete a maze.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Artificial intelligence is growing fast and there will be more ways to implement it in the future to different coding projects. This is important as a computer scientist will have a big effect on how it grows and that it advances in a safe way. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist it is important to form a hypothesis and identify the problem. The better we understand the problem it will be to it figure out whether this comes through testing or something as simple as planning organization. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As computer scientist it is important to understand that we have the power to make great change but also could make mistakes that could affect the end user or the organization. It is important we do our best to understand where ethical issues could arise in the projects we are working on.
